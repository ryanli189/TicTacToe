# Tic-Tac-Toe Multiplayer

## Description:
A server based tic-tac-toe game that will allow two clients connect and play tic-tac-toe. The game will keep
note of win-loss stats and display it under the client's name that the stat belongs to. We will be using
a server-client architecture with socket programming.

## Deliverables
